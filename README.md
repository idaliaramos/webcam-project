# Webcam Project

In this project I worked on manipulating an image to get effects to navigate around the view, similar to google earth: [http://webcam.surge.sh/](http://webcam.surge.sh/)
## Front-end built with:

* React.js
* Custom CSS Styling

## Goal:

Get locations from API
Provide an interface where users can view either the cameras or the control center.
Use Webcam API to add interactivity to the center of circle where users can manipulate the locations with their mouse/press.
